# Finding Fish with Tensorflow Object detection API

## Step 1 
On a GPU machine/VM go through steps in instalation.ipynb notebook.
It should clone tensorflow models and does all the required setttings

## Step 2
Copy fish_detection content inside models/research/object_detection

## Step 3

Run the notebooks in the following order

1. object_detection_tutorial.ipynb
2. create_pascal_tf_record.ipynb
3. train.ipynb
4. fish_detection_tutorial.ipynb
